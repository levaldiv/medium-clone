# Medium Clone Challenge

How's it going everyone! This here is a Medium Clone Challenge! I was tasked to create a semi-clone of the Medium website with full post functionality. This build utilized NextJS' framework for a much smoother experience.


## Core Features

- Semi functional clone of Medium (a publishing platform)
- Built using JavaScript and NextJS
- Built a login authentication flow with Firebase Auth using NextAuth
- Utilized Firebase's Firestore database for storing articles created from users
- Wrote robust code with JS and NextJS
- Leveraged Next.js Server Side Rendering to get a faster page load time
- With all that .. I hope you enjoy!
